# Currently an incomplete project.
VerbalFlow was created for HTN2024, but currently has a few (corruption) bugs.

#### What it does
Verbalflow gives its users tailored feedback on their communication skills using various APIs. It collects data about the user's face using vgg-face and facenet APIs, and it also records the user's word choice and tone. It then feeds all of the data it collected into groq's API to create it's feedback.
